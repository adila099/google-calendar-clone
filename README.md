# ðŸ§  Architecture & Design Decisions
React + Redux Toolkit: Chosen for predictable state management and clean integration with the component tree.

Redux Persist: Used for persisting calendar state across sessions without requiring a backend.

Component Structure: Divided by views (MonthView, WeekView, DayView) and modals (EventModal, EventDetails) to maintain separation of concerns.

Tailwind CSS: Enables rapid UI development with a consistent design system.

date-fns: Lightweight and modular date utility library to handle date calculations.

# âœ… Bonus Features

Scrollable time slots (similar to Google Calendar)

Event color coding

Responsive design for mobile and desktop

Fixed headers for better navigation experience

# âš  Known Issues / Limitations

No backend: data is only saved in local storage (not shared across devices)

No user authentication or calendar sharing

Limited calendar navigation (no year or multi-month view)
